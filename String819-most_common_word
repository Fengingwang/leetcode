# Time:  O(m + n), m is the size of banned, n is the size of paragraph
# Space: O(m + n)
# Given a paragraph and a list of banned words,
# return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words
# It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique
# Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation
# Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive
# The answer is in lowercase
# Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
#        banned = ["hit"]
# Output: "ball"
# Explanation:
# "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word
# "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph
# Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"),
#      that "hit" is not the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned


# 4 steps:
# remove all punctuations
# change to lowercase
# words count for each word not in banned set
# return the most common word
