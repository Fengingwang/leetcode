# You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student
# The record only contains the following three characters:
# 'A' : Absent.
# 'L' : Late.
# 'P' : Present.
# A student could be rewarded if his attendance record
# does not contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late)
# Return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record
# Input: "PPALLP" Output: True
# Input: "PPALLL" Output: False
# 给定一个字符串s，若其中的'A'大于1个，或者出现连续的3个或3个以上'L'，返回False，否则返回True
