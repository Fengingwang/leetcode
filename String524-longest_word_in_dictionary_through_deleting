# Time:  O((d * l) * logd), l is the average length of words
# Space: O(1)

# Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the dictionary
# that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string.
# If there are more than one possible results,
# return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.
# If there is no possible result, return the empty string.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
# Output:
# "apple"
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]
# Output:
# "a"
# Note:
# All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters.
# The size of the dictionary will not exceed 1,000.
# The length of all the strings in the input will not exceed 1,000.

Figure out how to check if a needle (word) is a subsequence of a haystack (S). 
This is a classic problem with the following solution: 
walk through S, keeping track of the position (i) of the needle 
that indicates that word[i:] still remains to be matched to S at this point in time. 
Whenever word[i] matches the current character in S, we only have to match word[i+1:], so we increment i. 
At the end of this process, i == len(word) 
if and only if we have matched every character in word to some character in S in order of our walk.

class Solution(object):
    def findLongestWord(self, s, d):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type d: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        d.sort(key = lambda x: (-len(x), x))
        for word in d:
            i = 0
            for c in s:
                if i < len(word) and word[i] == c:
                    i += 1
            if i == len(word):
                return word
        return ""
