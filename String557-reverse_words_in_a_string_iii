# Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence
# while still preserving whitespace and initial word order
# Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
# Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
# Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string
